 # 🎞️ ESP Home Cartridge Player

![Cartridge Player](Pictures/Cartridge_Player_3.jpg)

Bring back the magic of movie night — without the rewinding.

This ESPHome-powered cartridge player uses NFC tags and Home Assistant to recreate the nostalgia of physical media. Insert a cartridge, and your smart home takes care of the rest: turning on the TV, playing a movie, dimming the lights — whatever you like.

Whether you're a fan of VHS-era rituals or just want a fun new way to launch automations, this project combines retro vibes with modern convenience.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. Insert a cartridge  
2. ESP32 detects the NFC tag via the RC522  
3. ESPHome reports the tag ID to Home Assistant  
4. Home Assistant runs an automation based on the cartridge ID  
5. Cartridge removed? Media stops. Magic.
